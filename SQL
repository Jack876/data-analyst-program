The IN operator is useful for working with both numeric and text columns. This operator allows you to use an =, but for more than one item of that particular column. We can check one, two or many column values for which we want to pull data, but all within the same query. In the upcoming concepts, you will see the OR operator that would also allow us to perform these tasks, but the IN operator is a cleaner way to write these queries.
