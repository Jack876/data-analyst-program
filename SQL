The IN operator is useful for working with both numeric and text columns. This operator allows you to use an =, but for more than one item of that particular column. We can check one, two or many column values for which we want to pull data, but all within the same query. In the upcoming concepts, you will see the OR operator that would also allow us to perform these tasks, but the IN operator is a cleaner way to write these queries.
Expert Tip
In most SQL environments, although not in our Udacity's classroom, you can use single or double quotation marks - and you may NEED to use double quotation marks if you have an apostrophe within the text you are attempting to pull.

Questions
Provide a table for all web_events associated with account name of Walmart. There should be three columns. Be sure to include the primary_poc, time of the event, and the channel for each event. Additionally, you might choose to add a fourth column to assure only Walmart events were chosen.

SELECT accounts.name, web_events.occurred_at, web_events.channel, accounts.primary_poc
FROM web_events
JOIN accounts
ON web_events.account_id = accounts.id
WHERE accounts.name = 'Walmart';

Provide a table that provides the region for each sales_rep along with their associated accounts. Your final table should include three columns: the region name, the sales rep name, and the account name. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.

Provide the name for each region for every order, as well as the account name and the unit price they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. Your final table should have 3 columns: region name, account name, and unit price. A few accounts have 0 for total, so I divided by (total + 0.01) to assure not dividing by zero.
