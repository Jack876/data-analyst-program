Programming In Python
As you learn Python throughout this course, there are a few things you should keep in mind.

Python is case sensitive.

Spacing is important.

Use error messages to help you learn.
Variables and Assignment Operators
From this page, you will get your first look at variables in Python. There are three videos in this concept to show you some different cases you might run into!
Variables I
Variables are used all the time in Python! Below is the example you saw in the video where we performed the following:

mv_population = 74728

Here mv_population is a variable, which holds the value of 74728. This assigns the item on the right to the name on the left, which is actually a little different than mathematical equality, as 74728 does not hold the value of mv_population.
Use the code editor below to answer the following questions about verse and use Test Run to check your output in the quiz at the bottom of this page.

What is the length of the string variable verse?
What is the index of the first occurrence of the word 'and' in verse?
What is the index of the last occurrence of the word 'you' in verse?
What is the count of occurrences of the word 'you' in the verse?
You will need to refer to Python's string methods documentation.
A set is a data type for mutable unordered collections of unique elements. One application of a set is to quickly remove duplicates from a list.

numbers = [1, 2, 6, 3, 1, 1, 6]
unique_nums = set(numbers)
print(unique_nums)
This would output:

{1, 2, 3, 6}
Sets support the in operator the same as lists do. You can add elements to sets using the add method, and remove elements using the pop method, similar to lists. Although, when you pop an element from a set, a random element is removed. Remember that sets, unlike lists, are unordered so there is no "last element".
Context
Use the dictionary below to answer ALL of the questions regarding dictionaries. Consider you have a dictionary named animals that looks like this:

animals = {'dogs': [20, 10, 15, 8, 32, 15], 'cats': [3,4,2,8,2,4], 'rabbits': [2, 3, 3], 'fish': [0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 0.3, 1]}
